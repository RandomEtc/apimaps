This is the BSD-licensed code that powers http://guardian.apimaps.org/

It keeps associations between Guardian article IDs and Yahoo GeoPlanet IDs.

You'll need a Flickr API key and a Guardian API key to get started.

Guardian key goes in:
 - lib/init.php line 7
 - www/geocode.html line 20
 - www/search.html line 17

Flickr key goes in:
 - lib/init.php line 8
 - www/js/flickr.js line 12

There's some hairy javascript and some hairy php here. It was made by Stamen Design.
